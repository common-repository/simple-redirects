Simple plugin that redirects requests to another page on your site or elsewhere on the web.

== Description ==

Simple plugin that redirects requests to another page on your site or elsewhere on the web. By setting up 301 or 302 redirects from your old pages to your new pages, any incoming links will be seemlessly passed along, and their pagerank (or what-have-you) will be passed along with them. It's especially handy when you migrate a site to WordPress and can't preserve your URL structure.

== Installation ==

1. Upload Simple Redirects to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add redirects on the Settings > Simple Redirects page.
